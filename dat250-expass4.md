Experiment 2: https://github.com/Tellfisk/EXP4-master/tree/master/counters/counters

## Experience
The first experiment was overall quite hassle free, although I should have attended the lecture to see Postman in action, as I had to google a lot and try for myself for about an hour.
The second experiment was harder though, as I didn't know how Spark in Java works, and found very little help online/in the course files. This was a bit frustrating. 
It now runs fine and the CRUD operations are working as intended.
